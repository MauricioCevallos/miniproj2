    <p>Humans (Homo sapiens) are the most abundant and widespread species of primate, 
        characterized by bipedalism and large, complex brains. This has enabled the 
        development of advanced tools, culture, and language. Humans are highly social 
        and tend to live in complex social structures composed of many cooperating and 
        competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. Social 
        interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, 
        and rituals, which bolster human society. Curiosity and the human desire to understand 
         and influence the environment and to explain and manipulate phenomena have
         motivated humanity's development of science, philosophy, 
         mythology, religion, and other fields of study.</p>
