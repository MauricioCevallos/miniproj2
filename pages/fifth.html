    <img src="WWImontage.jpg.webp">
    <p> World War I, often abbreviated as WWI or WW1, also known as the First World War or the 
        Great War, was an international conflict that began on 28 July 1914 and ended on 11 November 
        1918. It involved much of Europe, as well as Russia, the United States and Turkey, and was also 
        fought in the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia. One of the deadliest conflicts in history, 
        an estimated 9 million were killed in combat, while over 5 million civilians died from occupation, 
        bombardment, hunger or disease.[4] The genocides perpetrated by the Ottomans and the 1918 Spanish 
        flu pandemic spread by the movement of combatants during the war caused many millions of additional 
        deaths worldwide.</p>
