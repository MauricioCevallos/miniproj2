    <h1>Wilhelm II, German Emperor</h1>
    <img src="will.jpg">
    <p>Wilhelm II (Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert; 27 January 1859 - 4 June 1941), 
        anglicized as William II, was the last German Emperor (German: Kaiser) and King of 
        Prussia, reigning from 15 June 1888 until his abdication on 9 November 1918. Despite 
        strengthening the German Empire's position as a great power by building a powerful navy, 
        his tactless public statements and erratic foreign policy greatly antagonized the international 
        community and are considered by many to be one of the underlying causes for World War I. When the 
        German war effort collapsed after a series of crushing defeats on the Western Front in 1918, he was 
        forced to abdicate, thereby bringing an end to the House of Hohenzollern's 400-year reign.</p>
