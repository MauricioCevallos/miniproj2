    <h1>Primate</h1>
    <img src="monki.jpg">
    <p> A primate is a eutherian mammal 
        constituting the taxonomic order Primates. Primates arose 85-55 million 
        years ago first from small terrestrial mammals, which adapted to living in the trees of tropical 
        forests: many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging environment, 
        including large brains, visual acuity, color vision, a shoulder girdle allowing a large degree of 
        movement in the shoulder joint, and dextrous hands. Primates range in size from Madame Berthe's mouse 
        lemur, which weighs 30 g (1 oz), to the eastern gorilla, weighing over 200 kg (440 lb). There are 
        376-522 species of living primates, depending on which classification is used. New primate species 
        continue to be discovered: over 25 species were described in the 2000s, 36 in the 2010s, and three 
        in the 2020s.</p>
