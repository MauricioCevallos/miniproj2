    <p>The emperor tamarin is a species of tamarin allegedly named for its 
        resemblance to the German emperor Wilhelm II. It lives in the west Brazilian states of Acre 
        and Amazonas and the southwest Amazon Basin, in east Peru, north Bolivia.

        The fur of the emperor tamarin is predominantly grey colored, with yellowish 
        speckles on its chest. The hands and feet are black and the tail is brown. Outstanding is its
